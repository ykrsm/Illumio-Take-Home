# Illumio Technical Assessment for Yuki Kuroshima

## Task
Description: Write a program that reads a file and finds matches against a predefined set of words. 

### Assumptions

Since there were no instructions regarding invalid file paths, I did not handle such cases. The script will throw a FileNotFoundError in this case. However, ideally, I should handle invalid file paths to avoid crashing the program.


## How to run the program 
To minimize issues related to environmental differences, I chose to use Docker to run this script.
My local environment has Docker version below.
```
docker -v
Docker version 27.0.3, build 7d4bcd8
```

To build, run unit tests, and execute the script, please run the command below.
```
docker build -t python-imagename . && \
docker run python-imagename \
--input ./resources/input.txt \
--predefined ./resources/predefined_words.txt
```
Below is an example output.
```
docker build -t python-imagename . && \
docker run python-imagename \
--input ./resources/input.txt \
--predefined ./resources/predefined_words.txt

To change the input and predefined words file, please place the files under the resources directory and update the command argument with the file path.
```
docker build -t python-imagename . && \
docker run python-imagename \
--input ./resources/<updated-input-file>.txt \
--predefined ./resources/<updated-predefined-words-file>.txt
```

To test maximum file size, please run the command below:
```
docker build -t python-imagename . && \
docker run python-imagename \
--input ./resources/input_20mb.txt \
--predefined ./resources/predefined_words_10k.txt
```

## What has been tested 

All the functionalities are automated in unit tests tests/test_main.py

It tests:
* Case insensitivity: Ignore case when matching
* Punctuation handling: Remove punctuation before matching
* Whole word match: Match only whole words, not substrings
* File size: Exit if file size exceeds 20MB
* Predefined word count: Exit if predefined word count exceeds 10K
* Predefined word length: Exit if there is a predefined word that exceeds 256 characters
* Predefined word duplicate check: Exit if there is a duplicate predefined word

Additionally, I manually tested the code with a 20MB input file and 10,000 predefined words.
