# Illumio Technical Assessment for Yuki Kuroshima

## Task
Description: Write a program that reads a file and finds matches against a predefined set of words. 
There can be up to 10K entries in the list of predefined words. The output of the program should look something like this: 

### Assumptions

Since there was no instruction around invalid file path, I did not handle such case. The script with throw `FileNotFoundError` in this case.

## How to run the program 
Docker ver:
To minimize the issue related to environmental difference, I chose to use docker to run this script.
My local environment has docker version below.
```
docker -v
Docker version 27.0.3, build 7d4bcd8
```

To build, run unit test, and execut the script, please run the command below.
```
docker build -t python-imagename . && \
docker run python-imagename \
--input ./resources/input.txt \
--predefined ./resources/predefined_words.txt
```
Below is example output.
```
docker build -t python-imagename . && \
docker run python-imagename \
--input ./resources/input.txt \
--predefined ./resources/predefined_words.txt

To test maximum file size, please run below
```
docker build -t python-imagename . && \
docker run python-imagename \
--input ./resources/input_20mb.txt \
--predefined ./resources/predefined_words_10k.txt
```

## What has been tested 

The main functionalities have been tested using unit tests located in tests/test_main.py.

* Notable test cases include handling punctuation edge cases with the test_count_matches function.
* Additionally, manual testing has been conducted with a 20MB input file and 10,000 predefined words.
